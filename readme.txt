== Description ==

The Merchi Plugin integrates with Woocommerce to pull your Merchi products into your Woocommerce store. It also provides access to the merchi shopping cart
feature, if enabled. 

Note that This plugin requires Woocommerce to work. It also requires an
account on https://merchi.co/. The plugin uses the merchi API as a third party
service to integrate merchi products with Woocomerce. The merchi privacy policy
may be found here: https://merchi.co/privacy-policy/.

Upon activation, Merchi will disable some core Woocommerce functionlity, i.e., the ability to add products to cart and checkout. Instead we use the Merchi cart to fulfill these use cases.
